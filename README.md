# Nearside Android Code Screen - Starter

Welcome to Nearside's Code Screen starter repository! 

## Quickstart

You'll need the following: 

1. Any JDK version between 11 and 15. 
   - note: as of this writing, Kotlin `1.5.31` does _not_ play nicely with Java 16 or 17. If you're using these versions, **you will have problems**.
   - You can try installing Java 15 on MacOS via:
   
        ```shell
        brew tap AdoptOpenJdk/opendjk # this tap is deprecated and should only be used for JDK15!!
        brew install adoptopenjdk15
        ```
1. Android Studio Arctic Fox (2020.3.1) Patch 3
1. the Android SDK (i.e. `$ANDROID_HOME` points somewhere real)

Here are the libraries the starter kit currently has: 

- Kotlin
    - stdlib 1.5.31
    - Coroutines Core + Android
- AndroidX
    - Core-KTX
    - Fragment-KTX
    - ConstraintLayout
    - LiveData-KTX
    - ViewModel-KTX
- Material Design 
- RxJava 3 + Android
- Glide
- Coil
- Junit

## What problem will I be solving?
There will be two parts to the problem: 
1. a coding exercise
2. wrapping that coding exercise in a little Android app

The Mobile@Nearside promise: we won't ask you to solve any problems that you learned in Data Structures & Algorithms class. 

The task at hand will be a straightforward programming problem for which there is an iterative solution that can be obtained in less than 30 lines of code. 

Other than that, you'll have to wait and see! üòÅ
